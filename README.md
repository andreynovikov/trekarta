__Trekarta__ (former MapTrek) is designed for hiking, geocaching, off-roading, cycling, boating and all other outdoor activities. It uses offline maps so you do not need to have internet connection. You can easily import places and tracks from GPX and KML data formats or create waypoints in application and share them to others. It lets you write the track of your journey, even in background, so you will never get lost and be able later see where you've been.

__Offline maps__

Trekarta uses OpenStreetMap based vector maps that are lightweight, offline and are constantly enhanced by contributors. Maps contain detailed topological data with elevation contours. Some map elements can be filtered out for cleaner look. Trekarta has built-in hillshades support. You can add custom maps in sqlite or mbtiles format to cover your area of interest. Custom maps will be shaded as well. Such maps can be created by yourself with SAS.Planet application from mostly any online source or converted with MapTiler and other applications from other map formats.

__Places__

Places can be easily imported from GPX and KML files or can be created within application. You can navigate to points and share them with others.

__Tracks__

Trekarta is designed to record tracks of your journey. Simply press a button when you start and press it once more when you finish. You can quit the application if you do not need to look at the map, the track will be recorded in the background.
